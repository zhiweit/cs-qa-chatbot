what is bcnf how it is different from 3nf,bcnf boycecodd normal form is a normal form in database design that is used to ensure that a database is free of certain types of anomalies and dependency issues it requires that every determinant in the database be a candidate key which is a set of attributes that uniquely identifies each row in a table bcnf is more restrictive than 3nf third normal form which only requires that the database be in 2nf second normal form and that all the nonkey attributes in the database be fully dependent on the primary key bcnf can result in a more complex database structure with more tables and foreign keys but it can help to ensure that the database is wellorganized and easy to maintain and modify
